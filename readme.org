* framegeometry
Restore your Emacs window to its prior position with Spacemacs

** How it works
Window position is stored in a framegeometry in your emacs home. Ususally, that is ~/.emacs.d
or ~/.config/emacs.d. When Emacs loads, it looks for that file and uses it to set window position.
If it's not found, it moves on gracefully. When Emacs closes, that file is saved with updates to
the last position. If you experience problems, it is safe to delete the ~/.emacs.d/framegeometry
file.

** Install
Assuming ~/.emacs.d is your emacs home:

Install with `git clone https://github.com/mattmc3/framegeometry ~/.emacs.d/private/framegeometry`

To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =framegeometry= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
